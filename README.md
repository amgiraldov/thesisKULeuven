# Thesis Project: Ontological search application in the Colombian Constitutional Court Jurisprudence

## Description
This research aims to provide an innovative tool to the Colombian judiciary that supports ontological searches of jurisprudence using machine learning techniques to increase, on the one hand, the efficiency of solving legal issues and, on the other hand, to produce effective and fair rule decisions. Hence, this project would supply a measure of similarity between court documents taking into account the meaning of the topics, allowing the identification of texts that deal with the same subject matter to facilitate the construction of jurisprudential lines.

In the Colombian Judicial branch, this field known as Legal Tech has been approached recently, meaning there is much room for research. In addition, the solution we propose is not only attractive to the Constitutional Court, citizens or jurisprudence’s users, but it has the potential of applicability in different legal organizations to present efficient and effective actions for protecting rights using the appropriate jurisprudential line
